# 👋 Hi, I'm Ana González

I'm a Backend Developer with a background in Biotechnology and Data Science, currently focused on designing and building small, well-defined backend systems using Python.

My work gravitates toward **clear business logic, data consistency, and predictable systems**. I enjoy improving existing processes or building new ones at a manageable scale — projects with a clear scope, solid foundations, and a defined end.

## 🧭 What I Focus On

- Backend development with Python
- Designing APIs with clear domain logic
- Working with relational databases and SQL
- Building systems that prioritize correctness, maintainability, and clarity

## 🚀 Projects

This section contains personal projects I’m building to deepen my backend expertise.  
Each project is intentionally scoped, documented, and completed.

## 🌱 Ongoing Learning

This portfolio evolves slowly and intentionally.  
I value **finishing projects**, documenting decisions, and improving one system at a time.
