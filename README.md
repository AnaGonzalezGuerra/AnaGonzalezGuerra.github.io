# 👋 Hi, I'm Ana González

I'm a Backend Developer with a background in Biotechnology and Data Science, currently focused on designing and building small, well-defined backend systems using Python.

My work gravitates toward **clear business logic, data consistency, and predictable systems**. I enjoy improving existing processes or building new ones at a manageable scale — projects with a clear scope, solid foundations, and a defined end.

## 🧭 What I Focus On

- Backend development with Python
- Designing APIs with clear domain logic
- Working with relational databases and SQL
- Building systems that prioritize correctness, maintainability, and clarity

## 🚀 Projects

### Backend projects

This section contains personal projects I’m building to deepen my backend expertise.  
Each project is intentionally scoped, documented, and completed.

#### 📚 Book Inventory API *(in progress)*


**Tech:** Python, FastAPI, SQL  
➡️ [Book Inventory Backend](https://github.com/AnaGonzalezGuerra/BOOK-INVENTORY-BACKEND.git)

### Data Science projects

#### M.Sc. in Data Science project

This repository collects the jupyter notebooks referred to the implementation of the models treated in the final master's work "Analyzing the influence of physical and genetic traits in cross training performance with machine learning".

## 🌱 Ongoing Learning

This portfolio evolves slowly and intentionally.  
I value **finishing projects**, documenting decisions, and improving one system at a time.
